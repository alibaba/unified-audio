# Unified-Audio: An Open-Source Project to Unify Audio Processing and Generation

This project contains a series of works developed for audio (including speech, music, and general audio events) processing and generation, which helps reproducible research in the field of audio. The target of **Unified-Audio** is to explore a unified framework to handle different audio processing and generation tasks, including:

- **SR**: Speech Restoration (â›³Â supported)
- **TSE**: Target Speaker Extraction (â›³Â supported)
- **SS**: Speech Separation (â›³Â supported)
- **VC**: Voice Conversion (â›³Â supported)
- **LASS**: Language-Queried Audio Source Separation (â›³Â supported)
- **CODEC**: Auido Generation (â›³Â supported)
- **AG**: Auido Generation (developing)
- **CODEC**: Auido Tokennizer (developing)
- more...

In addition to the frameworks for specific tasks, **Unified-Audio** also provides works involving neural audio codec (NAC), which is the fundamental module to combine audio modality with language models.

## key Works

### UniSE
[UniSE](https://github.com/alibaba/unified-audio/tree/main/UniSE): A Unified Framework for Decoder-Only Autoregressive LM-Based Speech Enhancement
supported tasks: **SR**, **TSE**, **SS**

## ðŸš€Â News
- **2025/09/22**: We release [***UniSE***](https://github.com/hyyan2k/UniSE), a foundation model for unified speech generation. The system supports target speaker extraction, speech enhancement, and lip-to-speech. [![demo](github.com/hyyan2k/UniSE?tab=readme-ov-file)], Code will comming soon.
