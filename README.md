# Unified-Audio: An Open-Source Project to Unify Audio Processing and Generation

This project contains a series of works developed for audio (including speech, music, and general audio events) processing and generation, which helps reproducible research in the field of audio. The target of Unified-Audio is to explore a unified framework to handle different audio processing and generation tasks, including:

- Speech Restoration (SR)
- Target Speaker Extraction (TSE)
- Speech Separation (SS)
- Voice Conversion (VC)
- Language-Queried Audio Source Separation (LASS)
- Auido Generation (AG)
- more...
