# Unified-Audio: An Open-Source Project to Unify Audio Processing and Generation

This project contains a series of works developed for audio (including speech, music, and general audio events) processing and generation, which helps reproducible research in the field of audio. The target of **Unified-Audio** is to explore a unified framework to handle different audio processing and generation tasks, including:

- **SR**: Speech Restoration (supported)
- **TSE**: Target Speaker Extraction (supported)
- **SS**: Speech Separation (supported)
- **VC**: Voice Conversion (supported)
- **LASS**: Language-Queried Audio Source Separation (supported)
- **AG**: Auido Generation (developing)
- more...

In addition to the frameworks for specific tasks, **Unified-Audio** also provides works involving neural audio codec (NAC), which is the fundamental module to combine audio modality with language models.
